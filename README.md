# wind_rotation
RUCOOL demo for using Oceananigans.jl to model the effect of wind rotation rate.

These are written as jupyter notbooks, the one for running the model cannot be running simultaneously with analysis one. You need to hit the reset kernel thing to get the simulation to close the output_writer. There is probably a cleaner way to do this, I do not know it yet.
